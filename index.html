  <h1>why ifran is a quiet city </h1> 
  <p>Ifrane (Arabic: إفران; Standard Moroccan Tamazight: ⵉⴼⵔⴰⵏ, lit. 'caves') is a city geographically located in the Middle Atlas region of northern Morocco. With an approximate population of 13,964,[2] the capital of Ifrane Province in the region of Fès-Meknès is located at an elevation of more than 1,650 m (5,410 ft).[3]

The modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1928 during the protectorate era for their administration due to its Alpine climate. Ifrane was conceived as a "hill station" or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans could find relief from the summer heat of the interior plains of Morocco. Ifrane, the house of Lake Dayet Iffer is also a popular altitude training destination,[4] but other destinations like Lake Dayet-Aoua enjoy a picturesque and calm nature located 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) north, which leads to a spring located about 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) from the center of the city called Ain Vital ('Virgin Falls'; ar).[5]

It is also nicknamed by the locals "Little Switzerland" because of its severe cold and snow that covers the slopes of its mountains in autumn and winter and mild weather in spring and summer.[6] It is also considered one of the cleanest cities in the world.[7]</p>
